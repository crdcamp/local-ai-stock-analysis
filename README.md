# Local AI Stock Analysis

This project is a small experiment made to summarize headline information for a single stock to test the efficacy of local AI for web-scraping and article summarization.

**Note:** This code require reasonably powerful hardware to execute successfully. I am able to run this on a MacBook M4 at relatively acceptable speeds.

## Setup

- Install the [latest version Ollama](https://ollama.com/) if not already installed. Ollama must be running in the background for ```smolagents``` to work.
- Install ```deepseek-r1:14b``` [here](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:14b). Simply copy the command and paste it in your terminal.
- Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in your terminal.
